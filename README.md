# Java Native Library Calling via Go

This project demonstrates how to call a native library written in Go from Java. The Go library implements a SuffixArray (`index/suffixarray`) algorithm with functions to create a suffix array, search for a query string, and free allocated resources. We compare three different Java approaches to calling the native library:

* JNI Implementation: Uses Javaâ€™s JNI to call a native wrapper that in turn calls the Go library.
* JNA Implementation: Uses Java Native Access (JNA) to call the exported functions.
* FFM Implementation: Uses Java 22+'s Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API to invoke native functions.

Additionally, a pure Java implementation is provided for functional comparison.

## How to run the samples

Build the Go shared library (libsuffixarray.dylib).

```
make -C go gobuild

# If you run the JNI version
make -C go jni
```

Use Java 23+

```
# RUN JNI version
./run-jni.sh

# Run JNA version
./run-jna.sh

# RUN FFM version
./run-ffm.sh

# Run Pure Java version
./run-java.sh
```

### Performance Comparison

```
# JNI
== Long Input ==
process time = 779 [ns/op]
== Small Input ==
process time = 378 [ns/op]

# JNA
== Long Input ==
process time = 4203 [ns/op]
== Small Input ==
process time = 2612 [ns/op]

# FFM
== Long Input ==
process time = 1745 [ns/op]
== Small Input ==
process time = 452 [ns/op]

# Pure Java
== Long Input ==
process time = 593 [ns/op]
== Small Input ==
process time = 102 [ns/op]
